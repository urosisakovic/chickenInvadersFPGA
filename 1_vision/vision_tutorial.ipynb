Part 1 will recap why ViT encoders are important, before diving into the three fundamental training paradigms. Part 2 will cover the classic fully supervised approach using labeled data. Part 3 will explore the self-supervised paradigm through Masked Autoencoders, where models learn rich features from the data itself without labels.  Finally, Part 4 covers contrastive learning with noisy supervision, using CLIP as our case study.\n",

        "**1.1 Vision Encoders**\n",
        "\n",
        "A vision encoder is a neural network that converts an image into a compact numerical summary called an embedding or feature vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "üñºÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüî¢\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What it does**: It acts as a translator, distilling complex pixel data into a format that a machine can understand and analyze.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What it captures**: This summary contains the image's essential visual and semantic content, such as the objects within it, their geometry, and how they relate to each other in the scene.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why it's important**: By learning to create high-quality representations, vision encoders enable models to perform a vast array of visual tasks (such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and even image generation) with remarkable accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.2 The Vision Transformer (ViT): A Paradigm Shift**\n",
        "\n",
        "As the Transformers architecture scaled well in Natural Language Processing, the same architecture was applied to images by creating small 2D patches of the image and treating them as tokens. The result was a Vision Transformer (ViT).\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary strength of the ViT architecture is its ability to capture **global context** and **long-range dependencies** from the very first layer, a key difference from the hierarchical, localized feature extraction of CNNs. Summarising key differences below:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Process images hierarchically. They use sliding filters (kernels) to capture local features like edges and textures first. They must pass through many layers to gradually build up a global understanding of the entire scene.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Vision Transformers (ViTs): Take a global-first approach. By treating an image as a sequence of patches, they use a mechanism known as self-attention (which we will explain in Part 2) to immediately understand how a patch in the top-left corner relates to a patch in the bottom-right, leading to a more holistic initial understanding of the scene.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.3 The Standard Workflow: Using Pretrained Models**\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, training a large model like a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch is computationally expensive and therefore rare. The standard workflow is to use a pretrained model, which has already learned a robust, general understanding of the visual world from a massive dataset like ImageNet-21k (containing over 14 million images).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have this strong foundation, you typically follow one of two paths:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fine-Tuning**: You adapt the model by continuing its training on a smaller, task-specific dataset (e.g., classifying medical images or identifying product defects).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Zero-Shot Inference**: For certain models, you can use them directly to make predictions on tasks or classes they have never explicitly been trained on.\n",
        "\n",
        "While using pretrained models is the common approach, this tutorial will pull back the curtain and show you how these powerful encoders are built and trained from the ground up, giving you a fundamental understanding of how they truly work.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.4 Different training paradigms**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three primary paradigms for training these encoders, each with its own philosophy for learning visual representations. We will explore all of them in this tutorial series:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fully Supervised Learning**: This is the classic approach where the model learns from a dataset containing images and their corresponding explicit labels (e.g., a picture of a golden retriever with the label \"dog\"). The model's goal is to correctly predict the label for a given image.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)**: This powerful paradigm enables a model to learn rich features directly from unlabeled data by solving a \"pretext task\". We will implement a Masked Autoencoder (MAE), where the model must reconstruct randomly hidden patches of an image, forcing it to learn the context and structure of the visual world.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multimodal Contrastive Learning**: This approach trains a model to understand the relationship between data by learning which samples are similar and which are different. We will use CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training), which learns to match images with their corresponding text descriptions scraped from the web. The text provides a \"noisy\" but highly effective form of supervision.\n",

This sequence of tokens is then processed sequentially through a series of EncoderBlock layers, which refine the token representations. After the final block, the entire sequence is normalized. To produce a single vector for classification, the model takes the **mean of all token embeddings** across the sequence dimension. This aggregated vector is then passed to the final linear layer (self.head) to generate the classification logits. Note that here we take the mean of all token embeddings for simplicity -- in practice, a [CLS] token is often used to aggregate the sequence information (please refer to [ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) paper for more details).\n",
